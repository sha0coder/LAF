LAF - Linux Application Firewall
This kernel driver blocks internet sockets, allowing only whitelisted process to connect to LAN and internet.

iptables filter by ip and port but not by process name, laf.ko is a simple driver for do this.


== configure == 

edit whitelist.h 

There are two whitelist, one is compared literally with the 
process name who is trying to create internet sockets.

The other whitelist is compared with strstr(), if you want allow all processnames whos name contains x word, then this is the wordlist for doing that.

For example chrome has process name with variable name, then this wordlist should be used.

Also put the sys_call_table address on whitelist.h, 
to get the address:  cat /proc/kallsyms


== run ==

$ make


This will compile and insert the module on the kernel.
If you whant to see what is blocking the kfw driver:

tail -f /var/log/kern.log

== filosofy ==

This is not a protection agains advanced attackers, this can by bypassed by changing the process name for example, or maybe with socket_call.

The objective is detecting and/or blocking software that should not be connecting to internet, as spyware.
